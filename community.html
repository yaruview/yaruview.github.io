                    <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/csa-at-uf/about-facss/108014192680165?pnref=lhc" target="_blank">Chinese Student Association</a> (CSA) at UF was founded in the year of 1985. The main body of CSA is graduate students, scholars and their family members from China. CSA is aiming at providing service to Chinese groups in Gainesville as well as interacting with local communities. CSA holds its annual show during Chinese Spring Festival and celebrates the festival. Almost every Chinese in Gainesville will come to the show. It is a good organization to join if you want to know Chinese people and Chinese culture.</p>  

                    <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/CASAatUF" target="_blank">Chinese American Student Association</a> (CASA) is different from CSA. Most of the members are students whose parents are Chinese but who are born in the U.S.. You can see a combination of Chinese and American culture in this organization. Also, CASA is energetic. It is made up of undergraduate students mostly.</p>
